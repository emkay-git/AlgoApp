# AlgoApp

Recently I joined Android team in my company. I did not have any prior experience in Android, so I started learning Android. As a part of this process I decided to develop my own sample app
to apply all the concepts I studied. I came up with this Algo App.

It's a simple information app where you would find links and information on algorithms, design patterns etc. I have also added a visualizer of dfs algorithm (pretty basic UI). App is still in a nacent stage, not on playstore but I wish to add lot of cool features to it.
If you wish to contribute, get in touch.

Here are some screenshots
